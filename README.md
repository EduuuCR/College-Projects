## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

Each project is self-contained. To run or test any of them, follow these steps:

1.  Navigate to the desired project folder:
    ```bash
    cd ProjectName
    ```
2.  Look for a project-specific `README.md` file or for compilation and execution instructions (e.g., `run.sh` or a `pom.xml` file for Java).
3.  **For Java projects:** Compile and run the main class.
4.  **For Python projects:** Run the main script with `python file_name.py`.
5.  **For browser extensions:** Load the project folder in your browser's developer mode (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
